# Excel-Dashboard-Project-Vrinda-Store-Annual-Report-Analysis

Project Overview:
Created an interactive Excel Dashboard for Vrinda Store's Annual Report 2022, analyzing sales trends, customer demographics, and order status to support data-driven business decisions.

Key Insights & Visualizations:
Sales Performance: Analyzed monthly sales trends with a line and bar chart comparison of total sales amount and order counts.
Order Status Breakdown: Displayed order outcomes with a donut chart (92% delivered, 3% returned, 3% canceled, 2% refunded).
Customer Demographics: Compared orders by age group and gender, highlighting sales patterns among adults, seniors, and teenagers.
Top-Performing States: Ranked the top 5 states by sales, with Maharashtra leading at 2.99M, followed by Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.
Sales by Gender: Visualized gender-based sales distribution (64% women and 36% men).
Sales Channels Analysis: Used a pie chart to show order contributions from platforms (Amazon 35%, Flipkart 22%, Myntra 23%, and others).

Tools & Technologies Used:
Excel: Pivot tables, slicers, charts, and conditional formatting for interactive visualizations.
Power Pivot: Data modeling and creating relationships for multiple datasets.

This project highlights my skills in data visualization, sales analysis, and business insights generation using Excel and Power Pivot, contributing to better decision-making and business strategy formulation.
